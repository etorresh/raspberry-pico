# Raspberry Pi Pico Projects

A collection of my personal projects developed while exploring the Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller with MicroPython.

## Current Projects
- **Reaction Game:** A game testing your reaction speed. Press the button when the LED lights up.

## Future Plans
After my exploration with MicroPython, I intend to dive into building my own SDK for the Pico using Rust. Stay tuned for more exciting developments!

## Note
These projects are primarily for my own learning. The repository focuses on code, and detailed hardware setups are not provided.
